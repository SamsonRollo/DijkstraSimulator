This app is a Dijkstra algorithm visualizer which
show the user how Dijkstra works on graph problem.
Especially in finding the shortest path from one 
point (source) to another (destination). This app
has two modes, the Source to All search, and the 
End to End search. The app also supports weighted
and directed, weighted and undirected, unweighted
and directed, and unweighted and undirected. The
default choice is unweighted and undericted.

How to Use:

A. Draw Menu 
	Simply create a graph on the Draw Menu or import
	any existing .dijg file. Errors might occur when
	importing a file if it's not properly formatted.

	I. The Select tool let you rename a vertex or 
	change a weight for weighted graphs.
	II. The Move tool let you move a vertex from a
	position to another.
	III. The Vertex tool let you create a new Vertex,
	be mindful that if you did not choose any vertex
	name, it will automatically name itself.
	IV. The Edge tool let you connect two vertices. 
	In a directed graph, the first vertex you clicked
	will be the tail and the second vertex you will
	select will be the head. If you want to reset the
	tail Vertex, click on the blank space.
	V. The Delete tool let you delete a vertex or an
	edge. SImply click on any of these elements. Be 
	mindfull that you need atmost 3 pixels from an 
	edge to delete it.

B. Run Menu
	Running the dijkstra needs an extra push before
	it start.

	I. The Start button starts the execution of the
	algorithm. Also starts the visualization.
	II. The Stop button stops the execution.
	III. The Reset button, resets the setup.
	IV. The Speed slider let you control the speed
	of the execution.
	V. The All radio button is a Source to all search.
	Refer below.
	VI. The End to End radio button is an End to End
	search. Refer below.
	VII. Input your Source vertex name to the Input
	Start textfield. The Execution will not start 
	unless it is empty.
	VIII. The End textfield will only be enabled if
	yu chose End to End search.
	IX. The Dijkstra Algorithm is visible in the 
	upper left corner of the application. This shows
	the current step it is taking.
	X. The Variables can be seen at the lower left 
	of the application. The variables gets updated
	everytime an update happens. 
	XI. The Visual Page, is where the visualization 
	of the Dijkstra Algorithm being used in a graph
	problem. Green vertex implies that the algorithm
	is currently evaluating that vertex, A red one
	implies that its done, blue is untouched. The 
	color of the edge also vary. Black for untouched,
	red for currently evaluated, and blue is done.
	When you chose the End to End Search, a resulting
	graph will e shown with a highlighted elements. 
	Green vertices imply the end vertices, red implies
	the intermediate vertices, red edge is the path;

C. File Menu
	File process.

	I. New menu let you create a new graph with a
	specified attributes.
	II. Load menu let you import a .dijg file.
	III. Save menu lets you save the graph you are
	working on.
	IV. Generate Graph menu let you generate a random
	graph.
	V. Exit. Exit the application. 


More Info: 

Source to All search, searches the shortest path 
and calculates its distance from a source node 
to all other vertices. This will result to a    
table that summarizes the search.

End to End search, search the shortest path from
the source node to a particular destination node.
This will result to a table that summarizes the 
search and a graphical representation on the path
with the shortest distance.
