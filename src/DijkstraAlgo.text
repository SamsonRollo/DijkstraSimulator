Initialize all distance as infinite

Create an empty priority queue Q
Insert source vertex S and its distamce equals zero

While Q is not empty
    Retrieve vertex u, the minimum distance vertex from Q
 
    Visit every adjacent vertex v of u
        If distance of v is less than the total distance of u plus distance between u and v
            
            Update distance of v equal total distance ofu plus distance beteen u and v
            Add vertex v to Q
